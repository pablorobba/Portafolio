# [Project 1: Data Science's finance Proyect](https://github.com/ChirixC/Yelp-Final-Project)

I worked on a project where I assumed the role of a data science company with a focus on finance, and we had to fulfill the company's objectives using Yelp and Google Maps data.

* Conducted an ETL and preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a given dataset.
* Developed data engineering and a data warehouse on Google Cloud with incremental data loading for analysis, directly extracted from Google Drive.
* Created Python functions deployed in Cloud Function, acting as a pipeline between the ETL process and data availability in BigQuery.
* Designed various machine learning models.
* Devised KPIs, metrics, and storytelling, with an additional emphasis on the financial domain.
* Extracted data to PowerBI through queries in BigQuery.
* Created an entity-relationship model and visualization report based on user/client requirements.
* Achievement: Project selected as one of the best in our cohort.
* Worked with an international team
    
I have also done about this proyect, with marketing elements. [Click Here For Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvxX24bK5Rs)

Tools: Python, Pandas, Numpy, SQL, BigQuery, Cloud Functions, Sci-kit Learn, Yahoo Finance API. Databases: PKL, JSON, Parquet, hosted on Google Drive; data extracted from Yahoo Finance through its API. Platforms: Google Cloud.

# [Project 2: ENACOM Data Analysis Project ](https://github.com/pablorobba/Data_Analyst_Telecomunication_proyect)

In this project, I analyzed data from the ENACOM (telecommunications) and performed ETL, analysis, and created a PowerBI dashboard.

‚óè Conducted ETL and EDA on data extracted from the ENACOM API.
‚óè Conceptualized KPIs and developed storytelling based on data and EDA.
‚óè Generated visualization reports based on user/client requirements.

Tools: Python, Pandas, Numpy, PowerBI.

# [Project 3: STEAM API Data Science Proyect](https://github.com/pablorobba/STEAM_Individual_Proyect)

I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) on a Steam database, developed a machine learning model, and subsequently created an API with deployment. Additionally, I designed a HTML cover page and a CSS presentation for the API. You can get this info from this API: 1- Money spent by user, 2- The user with more hours played by genre, and his hours played by year, 3- The number of items and the percentage by year by developer, 4- The 3 best developers by year, 5- Developer name and it's reviews (positive/negative), 6- 5 Games according to the game(id) you give.

* Conducted ETL on a given dataset.
* Developed a machine learning process for sentiment analysis.
* Deployed the API on an HTML page with CSS design.

Tools: Python, FastApi, Pandas, Numpy, CSS, HTML. Database: Data in JSON and Parquet formats. Platforms: Render.


You can access to the API [here](https://steamapi-h3u0.onrender.com/) (it can take a time to load)
